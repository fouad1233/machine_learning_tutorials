i assume for the same reasons\\r\\nwe had this rule - it used to blow up our old scheduling systems\\r\\n( pre - unify ) . some pipelines will require a new\\r\\ndeal and we will have to zero out the old deal .\\r\\nbefore you make the change - make sure the logistics person is aware - just\\r\\nin case it causes problems with their\\r\\npipeline . sorry - i don \\' t know which pipes these are - you will have to ask\\r\\nthe unify team .\\r\\nthere is one rule still in place - you can change from ena - im east to ena - im\\r\\nmarket east - but not from\\r\\nena - im texas to hplc - im hplc - when changing business units - they must be\\r\\nthe same legal entity .\\r\\n\" warning - not the same legal entity \"\\r\\nalso - beware of making contract and counterparty changes to service deals\\r\\n( transport capacity , storage , cash out ) .\\r\\nonce the deal is invalidated - there are no rules . don \\' t forget - the items\\r\\nwere locked down for a reason .\\r\\nif you invalidate a service deal - and change the previously locked down\\r\\ndata that was validated - and someone used these\\r\\ndeals in unify - it is highly likely that the unify deals and paths created\\r\\nusing these deals will get corrupted . always check\\r\\nwith someone from unify to make sure no one used these deals for anything in\\r\\nunify .\\r\\n- -

( mrs . ) mariam abacha , the wife of late general sani abacha ( former\\r\\nmilitary head of state and president of the federal republic of nigeria )\\r\\nwho died suddenly on 8 th june 1998 . i got your contact on the internet as\\r\\ni was making contact for a honest foreigner who will help save my life and my children ,\\r\\nhence our country has been frustrating us since the death of my husband .\\r\\ni have lost confidence with anybody within the country .\\r\\nhaving noted the confidence reposed on your person ,\\r\\ni became convinced of your capability and goodwill to assist me in receiving\\r\\nthe sum of us $ 20 million secretly willed in my favour by the late general\\r\\n( my husband ) .\\r\\nthis money was kept in a security company in amsterdam holland and i have\\r\\nall documents with me as of when it was deposited in a security vault for\\r\\nsafe keeping . this money has been defaced for security reasons and also to\\r\\navoid it been spent by unauthorized persons .\\r\\nit is not an ill gotten wealth rather , it was generated from my\\r\\norganisation family support program ( f . s . p ) . i will enlighten you more of this\\r\\norganisation if you indicate a helping interest to secure this money on my behalf .\\r\\non your acceptance to render this assistance to me\\r\\nto invest this fund abroad in a confidential manner until we came to a\\r\\nconclusion to use it to buy houses and part of it will be used for\\r\\nnon - speculative investments in your country . however , the current civilian\\r\\nadministration of retired general olusegun obasanjo ( the president of the\\r\\nfederal republic of nigeria ) is seeking vengeance on the abacha family\\r\\nbecause of the life prison jail sentence confirmed on him by my late\\r\\nhusband while in office . in pursuit of this vendetta , the present government have\\r\\nresolved to freeze all known assets of general sani abacha including\\r\\nproperties at home and abroad and are presently embarking on to seize the\\r\\nvarious bank accounts of my husband in swizerland , uk , australia . in fact ,\\r\\nthe attack on our family ( the abacha ' s ) is so devastated to an extent of\\r\\nseizing our travelling passport , family accounts and even trying some members of our\\r\\nfamily in court for offences allegedly committed by my late husband .\\r\\nin view of this grevious threat to our economic and personal survival , our\\r\\nfamily trustee have secretly protected the will , the security company has\\r\\ncalled me to do something about claiming this consignment because of the\\r\\ndemurrage it is incurring and i told them we would come and claim it very\\r\\nsoon . but my son seriously advised me to move the fund into an overseas\\r\\namount , hence the reason why i have chosen you and hope that you will come\\r\\nto my full assistance and unlimited\\r\\nco - operation . in the meantime , there is a travelling embargo on us ( the whole\\r\\nfamily members ) and our local accounts are seized . we are currently living\\r\\non goodwill of people who believe we cannot be held responsible for the\\r\\nsins\\r\\nof my late husband . in view of this plight , i expect you to be trustworthy\\r\\nand kind enough to respond to this distressed call to save me and my\\r\\nchildren from a hopeless future . and if you agree to help , we will\\r\\ncompensate you sincerely for your candid effort in this regard with 25 % of\\r\\nthe total amount of $ 20 million us dollars .\\r\\nin that case , when the money ( $ 20 million ) is moved into your\\r\\ndiscrete account , you will be allowed to withdraw 25 % in\\r\\nyour favour , while 10 % has been set aside for any expenses you might incur\\r\\n( there are demurrage to pay before the consignment is sign and claimed by\\r\\nyou . ) during the process of securing this consignment . the remaining 65 % will be invested meaningfully for my\\r\\nchildren ' s future . my cousin ( dr . yemi musa ) has perfected arrangements with\\r\\nthe trust company concerned and has been assured 100 % risk free and safe\\r\\noperation . what i demand from you now is to arrange to visit the finance\\r\\ncompany where this money is being deposited and claim it as the bona - fide\\r\\nowner . and in due course , all contacts must be made through\\r\\ndr yemi musa through this e - mail : address yemimusa 2 @ hotvoice . com and\\r\\nphone : 00221 512 48 59 . senegal .\\r\\ni look forward to your quick response while thanking\\r\\nyou for your co - operation . in view of all above\\r\\ndetails , i request you to keep this letter and\\r\\nco - operation highly confidential .\\r\\nbest wishes ,\\r\\nmrs . mariam abacha .\\r\\n\",\n",
