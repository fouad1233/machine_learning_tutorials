it runs through this processing on the application and generally doesn \\' t find a match . i know patti has mentioned this several times and i can \\' t think of a valid reason for performing this work . i talked with dave nommensen , and according to him , what used to happen is that sometimes schedulers would get duplicate paths out there which is why they put this code in place ? ? ? from a scheduling perspective , my understanding of what your main concern is to just maintain your position and be able to change it . if you were overpathed , you \\' d see it in the path manager either way . [ pinion , richard ] to restate the question for clarity , in path manager a scheduler pulls down a supply , market and a service , adds any up / downstream contract information and / or duns or drn override and then saves it . unify looks for an old path with those exact variables and if it finds it re - uses it and if it does not find an exact match creates a new path and path id . i had been told that to do away with this function would create an unacceptably high amount of paths since any path once nominated on could not be deleted . has this changed ? ? ? at one time there were some schedulers that looked for the same path / activity number match for nominations . texas eastern was the only pipeline that needed the old activity numbers no matter how long it had been since they were used . i spoke with chris ordway and the new link system no longer needs this to occur . transco uses activity numbers but uses the activity number cross reference table to that function and therefore should not be affected . therefore , if it does not create a space or memory problem for unify , i don \\' t think that this constant old path look up is needed . [ kinsey , lisa ] get rid of this .\\r\\n2 ) the scheduling position window : does anyone use this ? if not , we \\' ll remove the code logic that populates this window . i have never seen a scheduler use this . please verify . [ pinion , richard ] originally such a window was in use by everyone in the legacy system \" autonoms \" so it was duplicated in unify by request . it is not used in unify now because of the other sophisticated tools unify provides which obviate it \\' s use . the only value would be notification of bridge errors or contract imbalances but there are other ways to determine those problems . as voted on in a previous meeting of the managers - lose it ! [ kinsey , lisa ] why is this still here ?\\r\\n3 ) on the inventory pool list , does anyone need to see the contarct references list ? again , this code is called every retrieval time and doesn \\' t appear to be used from my observations . if they do need this information , we could provide it , but if not , i \\' d prefer to remove the functionality . [ pinion , richard ] this function is still very much in use by those with point based pipelines that must use the imbalance pool to facilitate balancing nomination volumes where multiple pipeline external pools exist and are pathed through the same contract imbalance pool . keep it ! [ kinsey , lisa ] yes . we use this functionality a lot when pathing pools .\\r\\n4 ) when pathing a one to many or many to one set of paths , what \\' s the average number of paths they create at one time ? what about updates ? i know that anr and nigas are big users of this feature since they have small packages of gas that they are limited in size to . does the system seem faster when you update one record at a time or chunks of records ? my real question is how often they do this and for what number of paths on both updates and inserts . by update , i mean , going to the path list and changing an upstream / downstream contract or a psna which in turn forces a new path to be created . [ pinion , richard ] this one to many or many to one pathing goes on every day on every pipeline . there is no \\' average \\' . they typically update a path with up / downstream meters or duns or dnb numbers one at a time however . i hope this answers your question . i see no change to this process at this time [ kinsey , lisa ] on some pipes this function is used more than others . when it is used we try and do as many paths as possible . at this time i do not see a need to change this process .\\r\\n5 ) on brokered paths , do you want to utilize the same logic we have for service ? in other words , when updating brokered arrangements , we don \\' t incorporate the same logic for zeroing out the path and recreating a new arrangment link and hence sending it to be renominated ? why do we do this for service ? is it because we have to renominate it ? i assume that \\' s what it \\' s for since we don \\' t send brokered paths to the pipe . anyway , with the nomlogic implmentation ( two way interface ) , we were planning on having it behave the same way as service . we need this verified . [ pinion , richard ] we don \\' t perform the same logic for brokered paths because these are not nominated to the pipeline and hence do not need a zero path to be resent to the pipeline when a significant change is made to the already nominated path . i don \\' t see a need to change the way brokered paths are behaving at this time .

structure that will\\r\\nposition hpl to effectively compete in the texas intrastate market . our\\r\\nprimary objective is to gain access to additional sources of gas supply and\\r\\nachieve the required economies of scale to compete with other intrastate\\r\\npipelines . i would appreciate your confidence and support in developing the\\r\\noptimal course of action for hpl and for enron .\\r\\nthe skills that we have developed in our group are critical to growing our\\r\\nupstream origination business in n . america , as well as to the ongoing\\r\\noperation of hpl . our origination strategy is to leverage our business\\r\\noperations , field operations , engineering , producer services , and marketing\\r\\nskills to capture value from transportation , gathering , storage and commodity\\r\\nopportunities on the gas / power grids . we need our current employees to\\r\\naccomplish this objective across n . america .\\r\\nwe have proven our ability to add value to enron by developing the\\r\\npowder / wind river pipelines , installing electric compressors , contracting for\\r\\nprocessing capacity , and establishing a new gas supply corridor along the\\r\\ngulf coast . our recent efforts to provide services such as business\\r\\noperations , measurement , trading / marketing , and accounting services to third\\r\\nparty producers and pipelines also looks to be a promising growth opportunity .\\r\\nit is very important to our ongoing business relationships and our\\r\\ncompetitive position in the market place that we do not discuss hpl related\\r\\nmatters with third parties . please come see me if you have any specific\\r\\nquestions or concerns . also please refer any third party inquiries regarding\\r\\nhpl to tim determing .\\r\\nregards

       " 'Subject: california energy crisis\\r\\ncalifornia \\' s power crisis has generated heated debate over the last several months . unfortunately , this debate has generated more heat than light . we want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis . please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation and our position on california energy issues .\\r\\nwhat happened in california\\r\\nthe source of california \\' s current problem is as straightforward as supply and demand . california \\' s economy grew 29 percent since 1998 . this increased the demand for electricity by 24 percent . at the same time , regulatory restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state . so demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added . the result , predictably , is a shortage . this summer , peak capacity will be about 10 percent shy of peak demand , leading to further blackouts in the state .\\r\\nin addition to the supply and demand imbalance , there are two other related factors that led to the current crisis . first , the state \\' s regulations forced all sales and purchases into the spot market . the spot market for power is extraordinarily volatile . the way firms behave in a free market when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases long term , medium term and short term , to reduce exposure to this volatility . in california , state regulation prevented this strategy . this would be the equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in the most volatile interest rate environment imaginable . everything was fine while the power surplus persisted , but when shortages ensued , every megawatt was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price .\\r\\nsecond , retail markets were not deregulated . regulated retail rates remained in effect , and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep competition out . this meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesale prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the regulated retail rate . they are now nearly bankrupt .\\r\\nin short , california \\' s problems were caused by regulation , not deregulation . regulations prevented competitors from entering the market , prevented new generation from being built , and prevented prudent hedging against volatile spot prices .\\r\\nat the time california was developing its restructuring plan , enron warned the state \\' s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives , which , if adopted , would have averted the current crisis .\\r\\nenron \\' s role\\r\\nmany political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than fix the problem . power sellers , including enron , have been vilified by the politicians and the media . here are the facts :\\r\\n? other than a small amount of wind power , enron is not a generator in the state of california . every megawatt we sold in california we bought in the same market available to other california purchasers . because we are a market maker , not a generator , we are not biased toward high prices . we are interested only in having a market that works so that we can package products for our customers .\\r\\n? as a seller to end - use markets in the state , we provided protection from the problems the states \\' utilities , and their customers , now face . we protected , and still protect , our customers from price volatility .\\r\\nyou may have read that ees recently elected to have the utilities supply power directly to its customers in california instead of procuring power on the open market . early reports mischaracterized this as a \" turnback \" of our customers to the utilities . here are the facts :\\r\\n? as a result of a variety of factors existing in the current california market , it made more sense for ees to source power for its customers directly from the utilities . this decision reduced ees \\' s market price risk by allowing ees to access lower utility rates .\\r\\n? ees did not terminate any customer contracts , and our customers continue to receive the financial benefits of their contract prices .\\r\\n? ees is continuing to work with its california customers to provide them with other energy - related products and services , including assistance in reducing the demand for power , particularly at peak times .\\r\\nenron is currently proposing solutions to help california work out of its crisis ; enron continues to sign up customers in the state ; and enron continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in western power markets . enron \\' s primary business is managing risk for our customers with solutions customized to meet their needs . there has never been more demand for our products and services .\\r\\nthe solution\\r\\nthe solution to california \\' s crisis is also straightforward . in summary , the state must increase supply , reduce demand , reduce reliance on the spot market and shore up the financial stability of the state \\' s utilities .\\r\\nincreasing supply\\r\\ncalifornia \\' s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing short of byzantine . enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in less than a year . in california , it often takes 5 to 7 years . california simply must streamline this process . ironically , while many of the regulations generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality , the regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and displacing current plants , which emit 40 times as much nox . california can have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new facilities .\\r\\nreducing demand\\r\\ncustomers in california today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand . they pay the same rate no matter what the market price is . an open retail market would trigger demand responses , which would balance supply and demand at lower prices than today . california should fully open its retail market .\\r\\nreducing reliance on the spot market\\r\\nin a truly deregulated market , customers would protect themselves from volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer term , fixed - price basis . the state has instead left procurement in the hands of the utilities , which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market . opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over their price risk .\\r\\nrestoring the financial integrity of the state \\' s institutions\\r\\nthe utilities in california are not paying their bills . this has led to greater uncertainty in the market , higher costs , and reduced flexibility to arrive at lasting solutions . california must permit its utilities to recover their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is needed .\\r\\njust as important as doing these things , the state must avoid policies that , while politically attractive , do not fix the problem or even make matters worse . price caps have been proposed . they don \\' t work ; have never worked ; and they will not work here . price caps succeed only in creating shortages , which then have to be allocated among competing users . imagine how ineffectively the government would be in determining , for example , whether it is better to make its limited power supplies available to the imperial valley or silicon valley . price caps are a surefire way to make the current shortage worse .\\r\\nthe state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in california . there is no reason to believe , and every reason to doubt , that the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in , constructing , operating and maintaining assets . this will also result in california tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power generation - - which the private sector can do - - instead of education , roads and other public goods - - which the private sector cannot do .\\r\\nas you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about the crisis from the media , it \\' s important for you to know this : we at enron will continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real solutions to the state .',\n",
