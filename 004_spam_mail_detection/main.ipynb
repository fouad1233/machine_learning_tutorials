( pg & e stated that southern union was intervening in order to gain leverage in renegotiating its contract for intrastate service . )\\r\\n3 ) southern union submitted data requests to pg & e on april 13 and april 17 . pg & e attempted to get a protective order issued , but ferc rejected their request .\\r\\n4 ) a settlement conference was held on september 7 , 2000 .\\r\\n5 ) a staff panel was convened on october 2 , 2000 , in order to conduct an advisory , non - evidentiary proceeding for oral arguments on the issues , with instructions to make recommendations to the commission within 90 days .\\r\\n6 ) on november 1 , 2000 , ferc requested 5 pages of additional information from pg & e in order to complete the application in the proceeding , which pg & e provided on november 8 th . on december 8 th , pg & e provided additional information in response to a ferc data request .\\r\\n7 ) on january 10 , 2001 , southern union submitted a proposed alternative to the cost of service and rate design that was filed by pg & e .\\r\\n8 ) on january 17 , el paso field services informed ferc that pg & e texas pipeline , lp had been acquired by el paso on december 22 , 2000 , and that the name was changed to epgt texas pipeline , lp .\\r\\n9 ) on january 24 , 2001 , epgt texas and southern union filed initial briefs .\\r\\n10 ) on july 17 , 2001 , epgt filed supplemental comments in response to the discussion at ferc summarized below , where commissioner wood inquired about the extension of some order no . 636 and 637 provisions to section 311 service providers . epgt stated that , if ferc proceeds with this policy , it should do so in a generic rulemaking and not in an individual pipeline proceeding . on july 30 , 2001 , southern union filed reply comments opposing epgt ' s supplemental comments .\\r\\n11 ) on august 3 , epgt filed an amended statement of operating conditions , which provides for electronic nominations , two additional nomination cycles , bumping , clarified and updated credit provisions , modified quality provisions to protect system integrity , and more clearly defined authorized overrun service .\\r\\nthe ngpa gives ferc authority over intrastate pipeline rates for section 311 service and requires that such service be provided on a non - discriminatory basis , but there is some question as to whether it gives ferc authority to require , for example , compliance with order nos . 636 and 637 .\\r\\nplease let me know if this is enough detail ( or maybe it ' s more than you wanted ! ! ) .\",\n",

tom \\' s words of caution :\\r\\nif someone calls you and wants to change a counterparty - we created the\\r\\nability for you to invalidate the deal - and\\r\\nthen change the counterparty - however - i did add a warning message :\\r\\n\" warning - changing counterparty on deal with confirmed volumes - make sure\\r\\npipeline allows this change . \"\\r\\nsome pipelines do not allow us to change counterparties after there is\\r\\nfeedback - i assume for the same reasons\\r\\nwe had this rule - it used to blow up our old scheduling systems\\r\\n( pre - unify ) . some pipelines will require a new\\r\\ndeal and we will have to zero out the old deal .\\r\\nbefore you make the change - make sure the logistics person is aware - just\\r\\nin case it causes problems with their\\r\\npipeline . sorry - i don \\' t know which pipes these are - you will have to ask\\r\\nthe unify team .\\r\\nthere is one rule still in place - you can change from ena - im east to ena - im\\r\\nmarket east - but not from\\r\\nena - im texas to hplc - im hplc - when changing business units - they must be\\r\\nthe same legal entity .\\r\\n\" warning - not the same legal entity \"\\r\\nalso - beware of making contract and counterparty changes to service deals\\r\\n( transport capacity , storage , cash out ) .\\r\\nonce the deal is invalidated - there are no rules . don \\' t forget - the items\\r\\nwere locked down for a reason .\\r\\nif you invalidate a service deal - and change the previously locked down\\r\\ndata that was validated - and someone used these\\r\\ndeals in unify - it is highly likely that the unify deals and paths created\\r\\nusing these deals will get corrupted . always check\\r\\nwith someone from unify to make sure no one used these deals for anything in\\r\\nunify .\\r\\n- -
