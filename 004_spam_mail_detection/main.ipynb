( otcbb : ) . ldgkcpf\\r\\ndear shareholder , addlrko\\r\\ni am writing to you today to\\r\\ndiscuss the new direction which your company will be\\r\\nheading . up until this point we made it clear that\\r\\nabdv would be open to opportunities in all sectors of\\r\\nthe market . our basic premise was to seek out\\r\\ncompanies that can be turned into positive cash flow\\r\\nbusinesses with the proper equity investment made into\\r\\nthem by abdv . fine wein records is an example of that ;\\r\\nwith a financial commitment of $ 250 , 000 by abdv we\\r\\nexpect fine wein to be able to throw off significant\\r\\npositive cash flow over the next 12 months from the\\r\\nvarious projects they are currently working on .\\r\\ne - direct is another example ; we should start to see\\r\\nsome meaningful positive cash flow developing and\\r\\ncontinuing over the next 12 months . however , abdv has\\r\\nnot maintained a particular industry focus . as of\\r\\ntoday that has changed . wmlgoioalpyxoduccgfir\\r\\nlast week we announced that abdv\\r\\nwill be providing $ 1 , 000 , 000 in equity financing to\\r\\nfuture quest , inc . ( pink sheets : ) ,\\r\\na company in the oil gas sector , this was the start\\r\\nof our new direction . abdv will be dedicated in\\r\\nlocating and provide managerial , accounting and\\r\\nfinancing for companies in the energy field , from oil\\r\\nand gas companies to alternative energy companies . jxyjbcwuomrbaypipswft\\r\\nyou may ask ; why the energy\\r\\nrelated field ? simply it currently offers many\\r\\nopportunities and with the price of oil approaching\\r\\n$ 50 per a barrel we believe there is a lot of wealth\\r\\nto be made in this sector . according to adjusted\\r\\ninflated dollars oil has not yet hit its all time peak\\r\\nof $ 73 from the 1970 s . however , unlike the oil crisis\\r\\nof the past , we are looking at what will be a problem\\r\\nto stay with us for a long time . simply put the demand\\r\\nfor oil world wide has increased by some 2 . 5 % this\\r\\nyear alone , most of which is because of china . the\\r\\nincrease in oil prices is not a fade which once the\\r\\nbubble bursts will result in oil back in the $ 20 - 30\\r\\nlevel . we are looking at a trend that is now cemented\\r\\nin stone . there are more players in the world economy\\r\\ntoday that require oil gas to propel their own\\r\\neconomies and this fact alone will keep oil prices at\\r\\nthese higher levels . abdv has already aligned itself\\r\\nwith individuals that have experience in the energy\\r\\nfield . these individuals will help locate viable\\r\\nopportunities and the funding necessary to participate\\r\\nin these opportunities . wtxrxayfisoira\\r\\nso what do we do with our\\r\\nnon - energy related businesses such as fine wein\\r\\nrecords and e - direct ? well , first of all we will\\r\\ncontinue to incubate and nurture these businesses\\r\\nuntil they are at a level where they can move on their\\r\\nown . i believe that both of these companies will be\\r\\nstrong viable businesses in 12 months from now . at\\r\\nthat point i will recommend to abdv ' s board of\\r\\ndirectors that we spin - off these two businesses to our\\r\\nshareholders . this strategy is in keeping with the\\r\\nbasic premise of our business module whereby we share\\r\\nthe wealth directly with our shareholders by bringing\\r\\npublic our portfolio companies . we can then continue\\r\\nto concentrate in the energy - related field . lvxhkmblmcewrw\\r\\nby concentrating on a specific\\r\\nsector such as the energy area we will be able to\\r\\ndefine abdv ' s purpose and guide it like a laser . our\\r\\ngoal will be to locate and make investments in no less\\r\\nthan four energy - related businesses over the next 12\\r\\nmonths . i believe that by maintaining this focus an\\r\\ninvestment in abdv will be looked at as an innovative\\r\\nway to participate in the booming oil gas and\\r\\nenergy - related fields . twqssqlqqkvbdm\\r\\nfine wein records , inc .\\r\\nannounces compilation music deal for theworld - renowned ` i love ny ' logo\\r\\nfine wein records , inc . , a subsidiary of atlantis business development\\r\\ncorporation , inc .

structure that will\\r\\nposition hpl to effectively compete in the texas intrastate market . our\\r\\nprimary objective is to gain access to additional sources of gas supply and\\r\\nachieve the required economies of scale to compete with other intrastate\\r\\npipelines . i would appreciate your confidence and support in developing the\\r\\noptimal course of action for hpl and for enron .\\r\\nthe skills that we have developed in our group are critical to growing our\\r\\nupstream origination business in n . america , as well as to the ongoing\\r\\noperation of hpl . our origination strategy is to leverage our business\\r\\noperations , field operations , engineering , producer services , and marketing\\r\\nskills to capture value from transportation , gathering , storage and commodity\\r\\nopportunities on the gas / power grids . we need our current employees to\\r\\naccomplish this objective across n . america .\\r\\nwe have proven our ability to add value to enron by developing the\\r\\npowder / wind river pipelines , installing electric compressors , contracting for\\r\\nprocessing capacity , and establishing a new gas supply corridor along the\\r\\ngulf coast . our recent efforts to provide services such as business\\r\\noperations , measurement , trading / marketing , and accounting services to third\\r\\nparty producers and pipelines also looks to be a promising growth opportunity .\\r\\nit is very important to our ongoing business relationships and our\\r\\ncompetitive position in the market place that we do not discuss hpl related\\r\\nmatters

       " 'Subject: this week \\' s woodworking tip . . . follow - up\\r\\ngood afternoon !\\r\\nno , this isn \\' t a new tip - just a follow - up on the one i sent this\\r\\nmorning . i received some good responses and wanted to pass a couple of them\\r\\nalong .\\r\\nkevin wrote to say that this tip works like a charm , except for one thing :\\r\\nhe \\' s had trouble with the router bit not being perfectly centered on the\\r\\nbase , so his dadoes have ended up less than perfect . i referred to this\\r\\nbriefly at the end of the tip , but here \\' s a quick solution for avoiding\\r\\nthe problem .\\r\\nbefore routing the dado in the gauge , first mark a point on the base of\\r\\nyour router . ( i simply add a piece of masking tape since it \\' s easy to\\r\\nsee . ) then when routing the gauge ( and later , the panel ) , always keep\\r\\nthis mark against the straightedge . your dadoes should be right on .\\r\\nanother email came in from mike , who suggested making two alignment\\r\\ngauges . then you can clamp one at each end of the workpiece before you\\r\\nclamp the straightedge fence down . this prevents the \" wiggling \" that\\r\\noften occurs when one end is clamped before the other . great tip !\\r\\na big thanks to all who have been sending in suggestions . it \\' s great to\\r\\nhear that so many people are enjoying the tips .\\r\\ntalk to you again in a few weeks .\\r\\njon garbison\\r\\non - line editor\\r\\nwoodsmith\\r\\nvisit our other woodworking and home improvement sites :\\r\\n100 + woodworking plans :\\r\\nwoodsmith magazine :\\r\\nshopnotes magazine :\\r\\nworkbench magazine :\\r\\nkits , jigs , tools , project plans :\\r\\nback issues :\\r\\nwoodworking forums :\\r\\nto change your email address or resubscribe , sign up again at\\r\\nto unsubscribe , send empty email message to :\\r\\nnote : your subscribed email address is\\r\\n',\n",
